<p>Some of you may have heard of Retrieval-based Voice Conversion otherwise known as RVC. It&rsquo;s a sweet technology that I have no idea of how it actually works. But hey either way I abused the hell out of it.</p>
<p>To start off with the teacher I chose to clone their voice was my math teacher, I&rsquo;ll refer to his as Mr P or PP (yes that is his initals). He&rsquo;s a bright bloke with a very enthusiatic and informative voice. He&rsquo;s know from some of his quotes such as &ldquo;Tri tri tri&rdquo; refering to trigonometry. Other ones include &ldquo;Log log log&rdquo; (Logarithms), his greet of &ldquo;Maaaaaaaaathamaticans&rdquo; and other like the <em>spice scale</em> of math questions. You see, some questions are just plain and boring, Mr P calls this questions just &ldquo;mild <em>white</em> spice&rdquo; since he strongly believes there some &lsquo;white&rsquo; person spice and &lsquo;asian&rsquo; spice. He gave us a whole anecdote about how he went to this asian restaurant and didn&rsquo;t know if the waiter was gonna give him mild or spicy even though he ask for spicy, he was going on about how the waiter could assume since he&rsquo;s white he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to handle the heat. Anyways&hellip;</p>
<p>Mr P records all his lessons, which is convienient for me since it allows me have a large quantity of his voice. Although later on I only needed around 1 hours worth. For my first attempt of recreating Mr P&rsquo;s voice, I tried <a href="https://www.descript.com/overdub">Descript</a>, this worked quite well, despite the fact that on the free teir one word in each sentence is replace with &lsquo;Jibber&rsquo;. So I did some research into other alternatives, websites like <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/">ElevenLabs</a> seemed promising but they were all paid services. I wasn&rsquo;t going to spend money so I could clone my teachers voice. Then I stumbled upon RVC, the tool that I would use for the final result.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many ways of using RVC, such as local on your own machine, through Google Colab and other online shells. But none of these were really any good. My machine wasn&rsquo;t that fast and would take hours to create a voice copy, google colab was quite finicky and didn&rsquo;t like me trying to create a voice. So at this point I was out of luck, until randomly on the AIHub discord server I get a ping from the announcements channel talking about <a href="https://www.kits.ai/">kits.ai</a>, the announcement said that the website uses RVC which was amazing. I got to work, and in 3 hours I had my voice model. You may think this is where this ends, but silly me didn&rsquo;t really that RVC isn&rsquo;t a straight voice clone, it needs a sample of speech to manipulate in order to make it sound like the voice I had cloned. This was another bummer.</p>
<p>For the next two weeks I spent ages finding a good TTS service that would be able to help me clone Mr. P&rsquo;s voice. I couldn&rsquo;t just use any TTS as some of them once put through the RVC turned out really weird. After some time I stumbled upon the TTS service called <a href="https://ttsfree.com/text-to-speech">TTSFree</a> which, despite it&rsquo;s discouraging name, had a large range of TTS voice&rsquo;s from Google and Microsoft. The website also allowed manipulation of speed and pitch. And thus the text document <code>how to - pp</code> was formed. It detailed the exact instructions on how to create the perfect Mr P vocie. Since then I recreated some of Mr P&rsquo;s famous lines that I mentioned earlier. Mr P still doesn&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ve done this, and I don&rsquo;t know if I want to tell him since I don&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;ll react, I don&rsquo;t exactly want to get expelled or suspended you know.</p>
<p>Anyways that&rsquo;s it for now, sorry for not providing examples of the voice clone, didn&rsquo;t think it was too appropiate to being sharing my teachers voice around online. Hopefully the next post won&rsquo;t be another month but I&rsquo;m not sure. Bye!</p>

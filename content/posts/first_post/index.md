# Hello there

Hi everyone, this will be my first post on this blog, and first post using hugo, I'm really terrible at hugo, cause well... uhhh...

![losts of workflows](workflows.png)

Yeah... But it's working now which is all that matters.

I hope to post a decent bit, my first *proper* post will be about how I made an AI voice for one of my teachers, it's a good story.

Anyways, that's it for now, see you in the next post!

### Edit:

I decided to delete the old repository and replace it with a new one, I was too embarassed at how many times it took me to actually get my website working, and it looks really weird with some bright green dot on my contributions thingy saying 35 commits on a singular day, all for this damn blog lol.
